## Building
It seems like the `Makefile` is slightly faster than using `CMake` but you may use whichever one you wish. Make sure to have an NNUE file under `network/latest.bin` if you plan on building the project. Tarnished makes use of [incbin](https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin) to embed the file into the executable itself, removing the need to carry an external network along with it. To build with `make` you may 
1. Clone the repository.
2. `make`
3. Binary is at `tarnished.exe`

Alternatively, with `CMake`

1. Clone the repository.
2. `mkdir build && cd build`
3. `cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
4. `cmake --build .`
5. Binary is at `build/Tarnished.exe`

        - Internal Iterative Reductions
 - Misc
     - Static Evaluation Correction History (Pawn hash indexed)
     - Soft time management
     - Lazy SMP (functional but not tested thoroughly)

## Non-standard UCI Commands

- `print`
    - Prints out the board, side to move, castling rights, Zobrist Hash, etc
- `eval`
    - Prints the current position's static evaluation for the side to move
- `go softnodes <nodes>`
    - Start search with a soft node limit (only checked once per iteration of deepening)
- `setoption name UCI_ShowWDL value <bool>`
    - This will display the WDL values computed from the eval. Default is false.
    - **NOTE:** The centipawn scores are RAW network values and not yet normalized, thus WDL makes use of Stockfish's normalization values. This will be updated soon.
- `bench`
    - Runs an OpenBench style benchmark on 50 positions. Alternatively run `./tarnished bench`
 - `datagen name Threads value <threads>`
     - Begins data generation with the specified number of threads with viriformat output files.
     - It should create a folder with `<threads>` number of `.vf` files. If you're on windows, you can run `copy /b *.vf output.vf` to merge them all into one file for training.
     - Hyperthreading seems to be somewhat profitable
     - Send me your data!
