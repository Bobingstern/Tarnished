## Building
You can easily build Tarnished with `make`. NNUE files are stored at [tarnished-nets](https://github.com/Bobingstern/tarnished-nets). The Makefile will automatically download the default network for whatever version you are building. Tarnished makes use of [incbin](https://github.com/graphitemaster/incbin) to embed the file into the executable itself, removing the need to carry an external network along with it. To build with `make` you may 
1. Clone the repository.
2. `make`
3. Binary is at `tarnished.exe`

## Non-standard UCI Commands

- `print`
    - Prints out the board, side to move, castling rights, Zobrist Hash, etc
- `eval`
    - Prints the current position's static evaluation for the side to move
- `go softnodes <nodes>`
    - Start search with a soft node limit (only checked once per iteration of deepening)
- `wait`
    - Ignore all input until search is completed. Useful for scripts
- `bench`
    - Runs an OpenBench style benchmark on 50 positions. Alternatively run `./tarnished bench`
 - `datagen name Threads value <threads>`
     - Begins data generation with the specified number of threads with viriformat output files.
     - It should create a folder with `<threads>` number of `.vf` files. If you're on windows, you can run `copy /b *.vf output.vf` to merge them all into one file for training.
     - Hyperthreading seems to be somewhat profitable
     - Send me your data!
